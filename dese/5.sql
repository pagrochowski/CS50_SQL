--DESE would like you to determine in what cities additional public schools might be needed. 
--In 5.sql, write a SQL query to find cities with 3 or fewer public schools. 
--Your query should return the names of the cities and the number of public schools within them, ordered from greatest number of public schools to least. 
--If two cities have the same number of public schools, order them alphabetically.

SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM schools 
WHERE type = 'Public School' 
GROUP BY city 
HAVING COUNT(*) <= 3 
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC, city ASC 
LIMIT 10;
