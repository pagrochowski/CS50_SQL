--It’s a bit of a slow day in the office. Though Satchel no longer plays, in 5.sql, write a SQL query to find all teams that Satchel Paige played for.

--Your query should return a table with a single column, one for the name of the teams.

SELECT name FROM "teams" WHERE id IN (
    SELECT team_id FROM "performances" WHERE player_id = (
        SELECT id FROM "players" WHERE first_name = "Satchel" AND last_name = "Paige"
    ));
